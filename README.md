⌗ 　꒰ 🏛️ Ka*veh* and 🍎 Ra*tio* kinnie ⊹ **5**teen  ꒱ 𓂅 Not in a relationship *currently* !!!𓍯
‎


usually free to interact, just dont be akward heh.. *Sometimes* w/ my [Bestie](https://github.com/hitchhikerb) <3 c+h is tots ok!! ask if im with friends

More in depth : : Feel free to walk up to me or cuddle! though i dont walk up to people myself since im a nervous reck. very introverted aswell. If you do wanna talk to me, keep in mind i dont rlly make moves first with new people. you must be patient with me!!

BYI: Please note that i'm welcome to anyone, and friendly IF I LIKE YOU. I judge based off first impressions. i'm naturally a loud person and talkative, but i like having people who can talk more than me. naturally ill get more talkative after im comfortable with you. 

DO NOT bring up any s3x/ual harrasment torwards me, it makes me very uncomfortable for reasons i wont share unless we are close. 

DNI: Basic dni criteria, more on my rentry

INT: If you share the same interests feel free to interact, im more of a listener than talker, so i like people who ramble. Im okay with cuddles, no need to ask. if im with others ask please.

Interests: My main interests right now are honkai, jjk, genshin somewhat! i like alot of other things and im willing to join other fandoms <3

also, dont copy my ponies. Not cool man. in the nicest way possible.
